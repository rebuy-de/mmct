```

* **expiry-field** The name of the field containing the expiration date of the entry.
* **--grace-period** Keep all entries that have been updated within the last `<days>`. Default: 5
* **--dry-run** Don’t delete anything but list what would have been deleted.

#### Delete orphaned assets

Deletes all assets that are not linked in any entries. Best used after the previous command.

```
mmct-trim orphaned-assets <space-id> <auth-token> [--grace-period <days>] [--dry-run]
```

* **--dry-run** Don’t delete anything but list what would have been deleted.

### Filling entries

#### Fill default value

Added a text field to a content model and need to update existing entries?
